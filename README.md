  console.warn
    Warning: componentWillReceiveProps has been renamed, and is not recommended for use. See https://reactjs.org/link/unsafe-component-lifecycles for details.
    
    * Move data fetching code or side effects to componentDidUpdate.
    * If you're updating state whenever props change, refactor your code to use memoization techniques or move it to static getDerivedStateFromProps. Learn more at: https://reactjs.org/link/derived-state
    * Rename componentWillReceiveProps to UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps to suppress this warning in non-strict mode. In React 18.x, only the UNSAFE_ name will work. To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names, you can run `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles` in your project source folder.
    
    Please update the following components: Survey, SurveyElementErrors, SurveyLocString, SurveyNavigation, SurveyPage, SurveyQuestion, SurveyQuestionCheckbox, SurveyQuestionCheckboxItem, SurveyRow
